	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a crucial concept in algorithm design that measures how the execution time of an algorithm changes as the size of the input increases. It helps to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm, allowing developers to predict its performance in different scenarios. Time complexity is often expressed using Big-O notation, which simplifies the comparison of algorithms by focusing on their growth rates rather than exact runtime values. An algorithm with a time complexity of O(1) runs in constant time, while algorithms like O(n) or O(n^2) grow linearly or quadratically with the input size. Understanding time complexity allows for better decision-making in selecting algorithms, ensuring that programs run faster and more efficiently, even as input sizes become very large.

		<b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. 
		Similar to time complexity, it helps assess the efficiency of an algorithm, but instead of focusing on execution time, it looks at how much space or memory is required during execution. 
		Space complexity is commonly expressed in Big-O notation, with O(n) indicating that the memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input. 
		For example, an algorithm that stores each input element in an array will have a space complexity of O(n), as the amount of memory needed scales directly with the number of elements. 
		Optimizing space complexity is particularly important in situations with limited memory resources, such as embedded systems or large-scale data processing, where excessive memory usage can lead to performance degradation or system crashes.
