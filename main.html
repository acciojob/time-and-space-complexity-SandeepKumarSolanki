	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a critical concept in computer science that refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of the input. It is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm, helping to assess how well it performs, especially as the input grows larger. A lower time complexity indicates a more efficient algorithm, capable of solving problems faster even with larger datasets. Understanding time complexity is essential for developers and engineers to choose the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem, ensuring optimal performance.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input data. 
		It is an important measure of an algorithm's efficiency in terms of memory usage. 
		<b>Space complexity</b> is typically expressed using Big-O notation, where O(n) indicates that the memory required grows linearly with the size of the input.
		For example, an algorithm that stores data in a list or array will have a <b>Space complexity</b> of O(n) if it uses memory proportional to the number of elements in the input. 
		Understanding space complexity helps developers optimize the memory consumption of their programs, especially when working with large datasets or memory-constrained environments.
