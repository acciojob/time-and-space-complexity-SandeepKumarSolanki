    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. It helps in evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm, allowing developers to make better choices about which algorithms to use based on the size of the problem.</p>

    <p><b>Space complexity</b>, on the other hand, evaluates the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. An algorithm with <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) will use memory that scales linearly with the input size.</p>
