	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a crucial concept in algorithm design that measures how the execution time of an algorithm changes as the size of the input increases. It helps to evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm, allowing developers to predict its performance in different scenarios. Time complexity is often expressed using Big-O notation, which simplifies the comparison of algorithms by focusing on their growth rates rather than exact runtime values. An algorithm with a time complexity of O(1) runs in constant time, while algorithms like O(n) or O(n^2) grow linearly or quadratically with the input size. Understanding time complexity allows for better decision-making in selecting algorithms, ensuring that programs run faster and more efficiently, even as input sizes become very large.

		<b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. 
		Similar to time complexity, it helps assess the efficiency of an algorithm, but instead of focusing on execution time, it looks at how much space or memory is required during execution.
